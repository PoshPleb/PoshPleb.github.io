This is the beginning of my new blog series where I will attempt to learn new things in PowerShell.

I've always wanted to publish some work related to my findings in PowerShell. I've been quite hesitant because I'll be honest I'm just a beginner who lacks experience! At first I'd associate my lack of experience with stupidity, but in reality I just don't know everything. So I guess you could say I was worried to show everyone just how stupid I am! HA! 

So with this new blog comes a new mindset. I'm using this new platform as a way to teach myself some new things! I find that teaching a topic really solidifies what I learn.

Thank you for joining me in this journey!
